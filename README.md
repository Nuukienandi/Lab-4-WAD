Project Description

This project is a registration and profile management system built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to fill out a registration form, submit their details, and immediately see a profile card generated for them. All submitted profiles are also listed in a summary table, and users can remove any profile, which deletes both the card and the corresponding table row.



Features

User Registration Form: Users can enter their details through a clean, accessible form.

Inline Validation: Instant feedback highlights invalid fields and provides helpful error messages.

Profile Cards: Each submission generates a dynamic profile card showing the user’s information.

Summary Table: All profiles are listed in a table that stays in sync with the cards.

Remove Functionality: Users can delete a profile, which removes both the card and its table row.

Data Persistence: Profiles are saved in LocalStorage, so data remains after refreshing the page.

Responsive Design: Works well on both mobile and desktop screens.
